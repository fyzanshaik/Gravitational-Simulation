# Gravitational-Simulation
Using gravitational physics through a visually engaging simulation, launching spacecraft in orbital motion around a central planet for interactive learning and fun.
# Interactive Gravitational Simulation
This Python project provides an interactive gravitational simulation that lets you explore the principles of gravity and orbital dynamics. You can create and launch spacecraft, observe their orbital motion around a central planet, and learn about the effects of gravitational forces on objects in space.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to download and run the simulation on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

# Clone the repository to your local machine
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-gravitational-simulation.git
```
# Navigate to the project directory
  ```bash
    cd interactive-gravitational-simulation
```
# Install the required library using pip
  ```bash
    pip install pygame
```
# Run the simulation
```bash
python main.py
```
